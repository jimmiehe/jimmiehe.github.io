## Welcome to Jimmie's Blog

I'm a software developer with a particular interest in control system.

My main job is programming in Embedded C,C++ and a little python script to improve my productivity of coding.

I am also interested in ARM/x86 Assembly, Emulation and all low-level programming stuff.

Now I focus on the embedded software development for Automation Control System.

I am working on some algorithm which will be interact plain C code with some core matlab mex component.
